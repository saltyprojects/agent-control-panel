# Agent Control Panel

## The Problem

Teams running multiple AI agents face:
- No visibility into what agents are doing

- No permission controls
- No easy way to spawn/kill agents

- **Real-time monitoring** - See all running agents at a glance
- **Cost tracking** - Total spend across all agents
- **Permission management** - Control what each agent can access
- **One-click controls** - Spawn new agents or kill runaway ones
- **Live activity logs** - Know exactly what each agent is doing
